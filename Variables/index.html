    <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>A JavaScript Variable is just a name of storage</h2>
    <p>And we can give that name in three ways</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using <code>let</code> Keyword</li>
        <li>Using <code>const</code> Keyword</li>
        <li>Using <code>var</code> Keyword</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rules for naming Variables.</h3>
    <p>A variable name can conatain any of the following character but must not start with a digit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Capital Letters: A to Z</li>
        <li>Small Letters: a to z</li>
        <li>Digits: 0 to 9 (but we can't start variable name with digit)</li>
        <li>Special Character: we only use two specail characters that is underscore(_) and doller(&) between the letters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We define variable by three cases like: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Camelcase: In camelcase we write a varible like this 'userIntro'</li>
        <li>Snakecase: In this we write a variable in lower case like 'userintro'</li>
        <li>Underscore: In this case we user underscore between the letters</li>
        <li>Kebab case: we use hypen(-)instead of underscore </li>
        <li>Pascal case: start with capital letter. in case of multiple word so all word start with capital letter</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Let Variable</h3>
    <p>In this variable we can change the value anytime and anywhere.</p>
    <h3>Const Variable</h3>
    <p>In this variable first we cannot change its value and we have to 
        initilised the values of const. if we not put the value on it then it's throwing error.</p>
    <h3>Var variable</h3>
    <p>This variable is very old, now we cannot used it. It is similar to let variable 
        but there is a one diffrence that is we use var in block code but let is not used in block when we use block in let then show error of not definde value . </p>
